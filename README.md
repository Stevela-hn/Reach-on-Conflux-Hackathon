# Reach-on-Conflux-Hackathon
Top 10 Project over 45 teams in Reach on Conflux Hackathon
Topic: Unique Number game
Principle:
Lock/choose the participants.
Get theirs IDs.
Start to take the guess within a range of 1-10.
Each of the participants guesses an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusion), afterwards, we look at the guess sets and figure out which of the number(s) is(are) unique —— their owners (the participants) turns out to be the winners.
